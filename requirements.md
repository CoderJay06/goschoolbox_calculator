Requirements:
The minimum requirements for your calculator are the following:
● Support the 4 basic operators (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division)
● Support decimal arithmetic
● Be composed of at least 3 distinct React components
● Cannot use built-in Javascript functions like eval() that would oversimplify your solution
Beyond the above requirements, we strongly suggest that candidates extend their calculator’s
functionality in ways that will make their submission stand out relative to other candidates’
submissions. Additional ideas to implement include, but are not limited to:
● Supporting additional functions (Square root, exponents, factorial, etc).
● Supporting PEMDAS for equations with more than two operands.
● Comprehensive edge case handling for potential user inputs
● A strong, object-oriented, React component design that makes the
logical flow of your coding implementation clear and easy to follow
We leave much of the final calculator requirements open-ended since we’d like to see
candidates impress us with their submissions.
We look forward to seeing what you create!
Assessment:
We will be assessing your submission primarily on two fronts:

1. From a user’s perspective:
   a) Is your calculator intuitive to use?
   b) Are we able to evaluate expressions on your calculator in a way that is sufficient
   for a high school Calculus course?
   c) If we enter an invalid input, how are we able to recover back to a state to start our
   next expression?
2. From a coding/design perspective:
   a) Do you properly update your React component's state according to best
   practices?
   b) Do you handle arithmetic updates in a way such that someone reviewing your
   implementation for the first time can quickly understand the gist of your
   implementation?
   c) Do you properly account for edge cases in your implementation?
   Your calculator should be styled with enough CSS so that it is intuitive to use. Though the
   styling code you write is important for rendering your calculator in a usable state, our evaluation
   will be primarily based upon the Javascript code you write. We will always prefer rudimentarily
   styled calculators with a broad feature-set and strong design principles over a submission that
   has nice styling, but poor design and a narrow feature-set.
   Submission:
   Once you have completed your app, please upload your code repository to a project on Github
   and email us the link to your project. Please email submissions to info@goschoolbox.com with
   the following:
   ● The title should be: “GoSchoolBox Coding Challenge: {yourName}”.
   ● In the body of the email, please provide the link to the Github repo.
   ● Also, include a few sentences explaining how you approached the problem, what your
   general thought process was while completing it, and what the main challenges were
   for you + how you overcame them.
